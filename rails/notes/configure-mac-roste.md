Certainly, here's a step-by-step guide to remove Homebrew, reinstall it, and set up `rbenv` without errors:

1. **Uninstall Homebrew:**

   First, let's uninstall Homebrew. Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
   ```

   This command will remove Homebrew and all the packages it installed.

2. **Install Homebrew:**

   Now, let's reinstall Homebrew. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Install rbenv and ruby-build:**

   Once Homebrew is installed, we can use it to install `rbenv` and `ruby-build`. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   brew install rbenv
   brew install ruby-build
   ```

4. **Configure rbenv in your shell:**

   Add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc` file to initialize `rbenv` whenever you start a new shell session:

   ```bash
   if which rbenv > /dev/null; then
     eval "$(rbenv init -)"
   fi
   ```

   You can add these lines using the following command:

   ```bash
   echo 'if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(rbenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

5. **Reload your shell:**

   To apply the changes to your current terminal session, either close and reopen your terminal or run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

6. **Install Ruby:**

   You can now use `rbenv` to install the Ruby version you want. For example, to install Ruby 3.2.2, run:

   ```bash
   rbenv install 3.2.2
   ```

7. **Set the global Ruby version:**

   To set the global Ruby version to 3.2.2 or any other version you installed, use:

   ```bash
   rbenv global 3.2.2
   ```

8. **Verify Ruby version:**

   Finally, verify that the Ruby version has been set correctly by running:

   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```
