### Key Concepts:

1. **State Management:** Kel.js is a simple state management library. It allows you to maintain a centralized store of data that your application can read from and write to.

2. **Events:** It provides an event-driven architecture. You can emit events with a payload and register listeners to react to those events.

### Basic Usage:

Here's how you can use Kel.js:

1. **Initialization**:
   You start by initializing a Kel instance, optionally providing an initial state.

   ```javascript
   const myStore = Kel({ key: 'value' });
   ```

2. **Emitting Events**:
   You can emit events with a name and an optional payload. The payload can be an object or a function that receives the current store and returns an object. The emitted event will update the store and trigger registered listeners.

   ```javascript
   myStore.emit('eventName', { someData: 'newData' });
   ```

3. **Listening to Events**:
   Register listeners to respond to specific events. These listeners can specify dependencies, which are keys from the store. The listener callback will be called when the specified event is emitted, and it will receive the requested data based on the dependencies.

   ```javascript
   myStore.on('eventName', (data) => {
     console.log(data);
   }, ['key']); // 'key' is a dependency
   ```

### Example:

Here's a simple example of how you might use Kel.js:

```javascript
const myStore = Kel({ count: 0 });

myStore.on('increment', (data) => {
  console.log('Incremented:', data.count);
}, ['count']);

myStore.emit('increment', (store) => {
  return { count: store.count + 1 };
});
```

In this example, we initialize a store with an initial count of 0. We register a listener for the 'increment' event, specifying that it depends on the 'count' key in the store. When we emit the 'increment' event, it updates the store and triggers the listener.

You can explore and experiment with Kel.js to understand its behavior better. If you have specific questions or need assistance with any aspect of Kel.js or JavaScript development, please feel free to ask.
