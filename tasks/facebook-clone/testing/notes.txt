Variables
  Data types, Variable Naming

 

Objects
  ES6 object syntax, and handling.

 

Conditionals
  if, else if, else, switch, and ternary syntax

 

Functions
  JavaScript function syntax, passing data to functions, the return keyword, ES6 arrow functions, and concise body syntax.

 

Loops
  how to use for and while loops to execute blocks of code multiple times.

 

Data handing    (This we can move to Part 2)
  Arrays, Object, LocalStore, Session, Cookies, IndexedDB

 

Event Handling
  Handling Click, Focus, Keypress, and other Events.

JavaScript Fundamentals:

Variables, data types, and operators.
Control flow (if statements, loops).
Functions and scope.
Arrays and objects.
DOM manipulation (accessing and modifying web page elements).
ES6+ Features:

Arrow functions.
Template literals.
Destructuring assignment.
Classes and object-oriented programming.
Promises and asynchronous programming.
Working with the DOM:

Event handling.
Manipulating HTML and CSS.
Traversing and modifying the DOM tree.
Creating and removing elements dynamically.
AJAX and API:

Making HTTP requests using Fetch or XMLHttpRequest.
Handling JSON data.
Working with APIs to retrieve and manipulate data



Variables, data types, and operators.

let allows you to declare a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned later.
var declares a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned. However, it has some hoisting behavior that can lead to unexpected results.
const declares a block-scoped variable that cannot be reassigned after it's initialized. However, for complex data types like objects and arrays, the internal properties can still be modified.

let age = 25; // Number
let name = 'John'; // String
let isStudent = true; // Boolean

let sum = 5 + 3; // Arithmetic operator
let isEqual = age === 25; // Comparison operator
let isAdult = age >= 18 && isStudent === false; // Logical operator

console.log(age, name, isStudent); // Output: 25, 'John', true
console.log(sum, isEqual, isAdult); // Output: 8, true, false



Control flow (if statements, loops)

as all programming language have

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('You are an adult.');
} else {
  console.log('You are not yet an adult.');
}
